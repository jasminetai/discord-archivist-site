      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>I can't add my account!</h3>
        <p>Check:
        <ul>
          <li>Are you using the command correctly? For instance, <code>,add Archivist</code> would add an account named
            "Archivist". Capitalization doesn't matter, but double-check your spelling.</li>
          <li>Are you joining the verification lobby while logged in with the specified account? Note that clicking the
            join link isn't enough; you need to be in the game lobby for Archivist to verify you.</li>
          <li>Are you joining the verification lobby quickly enough? The provided link expires 60 seconds after the
            command is issued.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>I can't add my clan!</h3>
        <p>Check:
        <ul>
          <li>Are you using the command correctly? For instance, <code>,addclan CLAN</code> would add the clan "CLAN".
            Note that <code>addclan</code> is a single word.</li>
          <li>Are you the leader of the clan? If not, you won't be able to add the clan. Only the clan leader can add a
            clan to Archivist.</li>
          <li>Have you added your account using the <code>add</code> command first?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How do I invite Archivist to my server?</h3>
        <p>Archivist is kept as a private bot, meaning that there is no public invite link for the bot. Scaling the bot
          up and obtaining official bot verification from Discord isn't currently planned due to the extent of the
          changes that doing so would require, which would include migrating the infrastructure to support slash
          commands and securing more resources for the bot. Unfortunately, this limits the number of servers Archivist
          can join. Consequently, we tend to deny requests for adding Archivist to inactive servers or servers unrelated
          to Super Bandit RIP.</p>
        <p>If you are still interested in adding Archivist to your server, reach out to @Dreamery in the official <a
            href="https://discord.gg/Gg9aMZJE5a">Bandit RIP Discord</a>.</p>

        <h3>Why is Archivist insulting me?</h3>
        <p>You've probably upset Archivist in some way. We can always reset the bot, but it's a pretty stubborn bot.</p>
        <p>Your best bet is probably to apologize.</p>
